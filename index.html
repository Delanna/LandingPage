    <!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <div class="about-me-sec">
      <p>Hello and welcome! I'm Delanna, a self-driven and enthusiastic aspiring Web Developer. My journey into the world of web development and design began with a determination to turn my passion  into a tangible skillset.<br>

        Without formal schooling or paid experience, I've embraced self-learning as my foundation. My primary source of education has been The Odin Project, an immersive platform that has equipped me with a robust understanding of various technologies, languages, and development methodologies. Through countless hours of hands-on practice, tutorials, and personal projects, I've cultivated a deep appreciation for the intricacies of creating engaging and user-centered digital experiences. <br>
        
        While my path may not have followed traditional routes, my dedication to honing my craft and pushing my boundaries is unwavering. I approach every project with a curious mind and a commitment to continuous improvement. I believe that my relentless pursuit of knowledge, coupled with my creative mindset, allows me to bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to the table. <br>
        
        My portfolio is a representation of my journey thus far, showcasing projects that I've passionately developed to showcase my skills and growth. I am excited to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on meaningful projects, and contribute positively to the digital landscape.<br>
        
        Thank you for joining me on this adventure. Let's create something extraordinary together!"
